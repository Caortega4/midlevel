ppca/flowtest

this directory contains tiny files to enable quick testing
of the workflow, before running it on full-scale data

August 2015.

very sadly, the left track of 21d was apparently recorded too close to
the mic, and, very oddly, her outbreaths are sometimes periodic enough
to fool the pitch tracker.  So it's really not a great testcase
example to use for tuning up the feature trackers.
