Notes on the Centos 64 bit experimental installation

Jan 9, 2012 Nigel Ward


pdflatex and evince work fine, and are faster

firefox works fine, although flash is lacking

matlob and python work fine

silk? probably okay if recompile

srilm? probably okay if recompile

weka, praat? (never worked on linux before, but maybe can install now)

respond/dede ... recompiled okay but ...

   problem 1: missing /dev/dsp

  simple solution: prefix "padsp", as in "padsp dede test.au"
  this claims to enable oss emulation in PulseAudio, however
  on playback it sounds like underwater; ie. audio coding is wrong

  proper solution: recode the audio functions of the whole suite 
  in PulseAudio ... probably not too hard since all audio functions
  are everything's isolated in auutil.c


respond/dede problem 2: f0calc fails

   can't even tell what's wrong; to do this need to get
   the Japanese fonts to display in kterm

   Long-term solution is to switch to another pitch tracker,
   for example the one in Snack/Wavesurfer

printing ... works using gedit, as before

Notes: kmix is the mixer; aplay works as before
